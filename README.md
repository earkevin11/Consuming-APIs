# API authentication and consumption

# Consuming CrowdStrike CSPM Oauth2 based API

# Important: The CrowdStrike API uses OAuth2 for authentication.

- OAuth2 enables you to do the following:
- Use access tokens to make API requests
- Manage multiple API clients within your organization
- Define limited scopes of permissions for API functionality

- Below is classic OAuth2-style workflow used by many enterprise APIs, including CrowdStrike‚Äôs.
# Important: 
- Each API endpoint will require an API key you use to get an access token during a post request. 

  
- 1. üîë Creating the API Key / Client Credentials in Falcon CSPM 
  - Note: Ensure the API key has right scope of permissions for certain API endpoints
  - 1. Create the API key in Falcon tool with required scopes/permissions based on CSPM API endpoint.
  - - You can find required permissions in the API documentation
  - API key will have client ID + client secret. Store in a secure place like Key Vault.
  - API key act as credentials for your request to the API endpoint (sort of like a username/password pair for authentication).
  - Read Only permissions have been assigned to this specific API key and it's required to make GET requests to the URL: "https://api.crowdstrike.com/settings/entities/policy/v1?service=" to retrieve CrowdStrike security policies by service

- üßæ 2. Requesting an Access Token (Authentication)
  - Before you make the POST to URL https://api.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token , ensure headers and body are correct
  - Headers should contain Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  - Body should contain client_id=<your_client_id> & client_secret=<your_client_secret> and grant_type = client_credentials

  - As shown above screenshot, when you make the POST API request with your API key to url https://api.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token, you will retrieve an access token aka bearer token

  Note: The API returns a Bearer token (access token) ‚Äî typically valid for 30 minutes or so.

 
- ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Making Authenticated API Requests
  - Once you have the bearer token (access token), you include it in the Authorization header of your next requests:
  - That is how you authenticate and prove who you say you are to the API endpoint.
  - GET "https://api.crowdstrike.com/settings/entities/policy/v1?service=Detective"
  - Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  - I am making a GET API request to the CSPM API to retrieve a list of all policies pertaining to the service "Detective"

    - If I want to get another list of policies for a different service, I modify the url to be "S3"
    - Example: "https://api.crowdstrike.com/settings/entities/policy/v1?service=S3"

- 4. Save the file and clean it with Python
  
Python code that will take ALL the json files in that directory/folder (aws_json_security_policies) and combine them into an excel file called aws_combined_resources.xlsx
#Important: Make sure you saved all of json files and moved it to the directory/folder so the Python script can go through each json file and add it to the excel file
